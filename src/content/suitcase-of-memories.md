Do you remember what you ate yesterday? A month ago? A year ago?

Do you remember your first kiss? I'm sure you do. Do you remember your last kiss? Maybe. Do you remember every kiss? No.

One day, just like me, you're going to die. And that's okay. You didn't exist for millions of years, so everything will be fine after you cease to exist for trillions of years.

In your last moments, the only thing valuable in your mind will be your memories. Your memories.

But we can't take too many with us at the end.

It's like a travel suitcase. The small one. It can only fit six days' worth of clothes. And that's it. You have to choose which memories to put in the suitcase, because at the end of the trip you're not going to bring everything.

You're going to forget the clothes you're wearing today. And this post. And most of your companions. To friends, girlfriends and sweethearts.

### How do you choose what you pack?

Creating memories.

### How do you make memories?

By taking risks. Stealing that kiss, pitching that idea, writing that article, showing vulnerability, stepping out of our comfort zone, growing, trying different things, rejecting routine and normalcy, being nonconformist, creating, trying.

Fear is an invitation. And every game we play is optional.

And what about real risk?

#### What if pain hurts?

Pain teaches us to take care of ourselves. Scars remind us what not to do and its consequences. So we avoid slipping and falling. We learn.

But time passes, scars heal and become memories.

When I grow old, I want to be full of scars like tattoos. Evidence of what I lived. I had fun. Or maybe I didn't. But I experienced.

What a waste to arrive at the end with a flawless, untouched, sacred human body full of regret. As long as you don't hurt anyone, it's better to arrive with scars. And stories.
